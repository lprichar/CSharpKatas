Overview
===========

CSharpKatas is a training tool for teaching C# newcommers how to apply advanced language features, how to write idiomatic
C#, and how to avoid Java idioms in C#. It builds upon .Net 6.0 and NUnit3 and runs on multiple platforms such as windows and linux.

Getting Started
===========

The exercises here are organized into Katas, or mind excersises.  Each Kata contains a set of unit tests and some 
todo's.  

Developers are typically asked to turn the tests green using any means necessary, then refactor using C# idioms (such 
as not writing loops or if statements without good reason).  

Anyone wishing to work on these problems is encouraged to create a branch and work the solutions there.  

Finally anyone unable to solve a Kata in under a few minutes is encouraged to delete their solution and re-solve it 
until the solution is second-nature (similar to a Kata in martial arts).

Summary
===========

This project was created for the C# community.  Enjoy, learn, and please feel free to contribute 
back updates or additional Katas (pull requests welcome).
